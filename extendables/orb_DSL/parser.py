    Problem: Writing code for Orb is long, boring, and tedious. It used to be a ton of 
    little helper functions. You would have to sort through a dozen interdependent helper 
    functions to figure out what any single orb button did. It worked, but wasn't easy to
    write or read.

    Solution: Now we've developed an innocent little Domain Specific Language (DSL) that
    makes writing Orb commands stupidly and painfully simple. With this, it could not 
    possibly be any simpler or it would be dead.

    Just write what the console should do in a txt file in plain English and it does it.

    This script is the boring backend. Each console has its own folder full of the txt file 
    scripts. This will eventually be implemented for the extendables API, but they can just 
    use regular Python until then.
